### Core Services (Backend)

| Service | Port | What It Does | Repository |
|---------|------|--------------|------------|
| **API Gateway** | 8090 | Main entry point for all requests | [fm-api-gateway](https://github.com/FaultMaven/fm-api-gateway) |
| **Auth Service** | 8001 | User authentication | [fm-auth-service](https://github.com/FaultMaven/fm-auth-service) |
| **Session Service** | 8002 | Manages user sessions | [fm-session-service](https://github.com/FaultMaven/fm-session-service) |
| **Case Service** | 8003 | Tracks troubleshooting investigations | [fm-case-service](https://github.com/FaultMaven/fm-case-service) |
| **Knowledge Service** | 8004 | Stores and searches documentation | [fm-knowledge-service](https://github.com/FaultMaven/fm-knowledge-service) |
| **Evidence Service** | 8005 | Handles file uploads (logs, screenshots) | [fm-evidence-service](https://github.com/FaultMaven/fm-evidence-service) |
| **Agent Service** | 8006 | Powers AI troubleshooting conversations | [fm-agent-service](https://github.com/FaultMaven/fm-agent-service) |
| **Job Worker** | - | Processes background tasks | [fm-job-worker](https://github.com/FaultMaven/fm-job-worker) |

### User Interfaces

| Interface | Port | Description | Repository |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|
| **Browser Extension** | N/A | Chat interface for troubleshooting (in development) | [faultmaven-copilot](https://github.com/FaultMaven/faultmaven-copilot) |
| **Dashboard** | 3000 | KB management UI (Vite + React) | [faultmaven-dashboard](https://github.com/FaultMaven/faultmaven-dashboard) |

### Deployment

| Repository | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| [faultmaven-deploy](https://github.com/FaultMaven/faultmaven-deploy) | Docker Compose deployment for self-hosting |
| [faultmaven-website](https://github.com/FaultMaven/faultmaven-website) | Documentation & marketing site |

### Pluggable Authentication

FaultMaven uses a **capabilities-driven architecture** where the same codebase supports multiple deployment modes:

**Self-Hosted Mode:**
```yaml
# Uses lightweight fm-auth-service
auth:
  provider: fm-auth-service
  jwt_secret: your-secret
```

**Enterprise Mode:**
```yaml
# Uses Supabase for SSO
auth:
  provider: supabase
  project_url: https://your-project.supabase.co
```

The API Gateway detects the auth provider and adapts accordingly. The browser extension calls `/v1/meta/capabilities` to discover which features are available and adjusts the UI dynamically.
