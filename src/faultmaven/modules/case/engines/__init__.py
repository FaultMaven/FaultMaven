"""
Investigation engines for milestone-based orchestration.

This package contains the core investigation framework engines ported from
FaultMaven-Mono. These engines implement the sophisticated investigation logic
that was missing from the initial migration.

Engines:
- milestone_engine: Main orchestration engine for turn processing
- hypothesis_manager: Hypothesis confidence and lifecycle management
- ooda_engine: OODA loop execution and adaptive intensity
- memory_manager: Hierarchical memory (hot/warm/cold tiers)
- working_conclusion_generator: Interim conclusion synthesis
- phase_orchestrator: Phase progression and loopback detection

Architecture:
- Service Layer (investigation_service.py) delegates to these engines
- Engines contain business logic (no DB access)
- State passed in/out as InvestigationState Pydantic models
